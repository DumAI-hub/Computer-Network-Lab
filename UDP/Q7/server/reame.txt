1. Purpose of addr_len:
   - addr_len is used to tell recvfrom() how much space we have allocated for the address structure
   - After recvfrom() completes, it updates addr_len to tell us how many bytes were actually used

2. Why reset it:
   - recvfrom() modifies addr_len during execution
   - The next recvfrom() needs the original size
   - Without resetting, we might pass a modified (possibly smaller) value to the next call
   - This could lead to buffer overflow or truncated addresses
